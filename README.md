## Description: 📒
Encrypto is a safe file transfer method to use rather than using files with password which can be cracked using brute force and other password cracking methods. Encrypt uses a ransomware technology for good. It encrypts any application or file and creates a key for it with an unique token in "/keys" folder. The key can be sent securely to the person who you want to access the file. Means post your file publicly but the one who can access it is in your hands!

## Motivation 😲
In the world of file sharing, we can see that is usually done with password protected files or the cloud. But, in this case there is a problem. The files are not encrypted and can be easily accessed by anyone. This problem arises because of the fact these file sharing methods are not secure and are vurnerable which depends on the person who is sharing the file.

### Why Encrypto? 🤔
Encrypto encrypts the file and creates a key for it. The key is unique and can be sent to the person who wants to access the file. The file is encrypted and the key is not. The key is used to decrypt the file.

### Why not other methods? 🤔
Even though other methods are extremely reliable and secure, they are not suitable for really confidential file sharing. Encrypto is a safe file sharing method because it is not vulnerable to any kind of attack like brute force or account takeovers. 

### Advantages ✔
- ✅ Encrypto is really quick as it encrypts only a small part of the file.

- ✅ Encrypto generates an unique token that can neither be found in any kind of word lists. 

- ✅ Encrypto is not vulnerable to any kind of attack like brute force or account takeovers.

- ✅ Encrypto uses the same technology as ransomware. It takes over an file and locks with a token.

- ✅ It is still secured even though it is an open-source project. Encrypto uses complex yet easy to read algorithms to encrypt the file.

### Disadvantages ❌
- ❌ The key should not be handed over to any person who is not trusted to open the file. As once he has it he can spread it too, which is not good. It completely depends on the person who is sharing the file. (Beaware of social engineering)

- ❌ The key is not encrypted. It can be easily found in the file.

- ❌ The key is one and only. Once lost, cannot be recovered.

- ❌ Encrypto is currently only maintained by only one person at this time and we're out for other contributors.
